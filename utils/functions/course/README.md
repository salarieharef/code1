# Documentation: `utils/functions/course` Folder

## Overview

The `utils/functions/course` folder is designed to encapsulate utility functions that handle the main logic for creating, editing, and managing courses in the platform. These utilities are focused on preparing data, making API requests, and handling the different steps involved in the course creation process. The folder breaks down specific course-related operations into modular and reusable functions, enhancing code maintainability and clarity.

---

### Folder Structure

1. **courseOperations.function.ts**: Handles core operations for creating and editing courses.
2. **prepare-data.function.ts**: Prepares various data structures (e.g., form data) needed for different stages of course creation.
3. **contentOperations.function.ts**: Manages operations related to course content, such as uploading videos or files.
4. **categoryOperations.function.ts**: Deals with category-related tasks, including flattening nested categories for better form handling.

## Files and Functionalities

### 1. `courseOperations.function.ts`

#### Purpose:

This file handles the core operations required for managing courses, including:

- Adding new courses
- Editing existing courses
- Preparing course-related data
- Setting default form values when editing
- Multi-step form handling for course creation/editing

#### Key Functions:

- **`AddCourse`**: Handles course creation by sending the data to the API and uploading the course image.
- **`EditCourse`**: Manages course editing by sending updates to the API and uploading any new images.
- **`setDefaultValues`**: Populates form fields with course data when editing a course.
- **`transformReferences` & `reverseTransformReferences`**: Transform course references into different formats for API submission and form handling.
- **`submitStep`**: Manages the logic for progressing through multi-step course creation/editing.

### 2. `prepare-data.function.ts`

#### Purpose:

This file is responsible for preparing the data required for different steps of the course creation and editing process. Each function in this file prepares a specific part of the course data, ensuring that the data structure aligns with what the API expects.

#### Key Functions:

- **`CourseFormDataPrepare`**: Prepares the general course information, like name, level, description, and categories.
- **`HeadlineFormDataPrepare`**: Prepares data related to the course headline or introductory section.
- **`PartOfCourseVideoDataPrepare`**: Gathers and formats data related to video parts of the course.
- **`CollaborationFormDataPrepare`**: Prepares data for the collaboration section, such as instructors and partners.
- **`ConclusionFormDataPrepare`**: Prepares data for the conclusion or final steps of the course.

Each of these functions ensures that the submitted data is properly formatted and validated before sending it to the backend.

### 3. `contentOperations.function.ts`

#### Purpose:

This file handles the operations related to course content, specifically uploading videos, images, or other course materials. It interacts with the API to send multimedia content that needs to be associated with the course.

#### Key Functions:

- **`UploadContent`**: Responsible for uploading multimedia content (videos, images, etc.) associated with the course.

---

### 4. `categoryOperations.function.ts`

#### Purpose:

This file deals with operations related to course categories. Many courses have a hierarchical structure of categories (e.g., grade, branch, field, etc.), and this file includes functions to manipulate or transform that data.

#### Key Functions:

- **`FlattenCategories`**: Flattens a nested structure of course categories for easier use in forms or API submissions. For example, if the course categories are grouped under branches and fields, this function will flatten them into a single list that can be directly processed.

## Common Patterns Across Files

### 1. **Form Handling and Validation**

Many of the functions use `yup` validation schemas to ensure that the data is correct before sending it to the API. The validation rules ensure that the form inputs are accurate, and handle common errors like missing fields or incorrect formats.

### 2. **API Interactions**

The functions heavily rely on the `nextFetcher` utility to interact with the backend. This utility simplifies the process of making authenticated requests and supports common HTTP methods like `GET` and `POST`.

### 3. **Data Transformation**

To ensure compatibility with the backend, many functions transform the data into different formats:

- **`transformReferences`** and **`reverseTransformReferences`** convert between flat arrays and nested objects for reference data.
- Form data is structured and prepared to match what the backend expects, such as transforming arrays, filtering empty fields, and organizing complex course structures (e.g., categories, collaborations, videos).

## Use Cases

### Adding a Course

1. **Step 1**: User fills out the course form, providing general course information.
2. **Step 2**: The form data is validated using `yup` schemas and transformed via `CourseFormDataPrepare`.
3. **Step 3**: The `AddCourse` function sends the prepared data to the backend and handles image uploads.
4. **Step 4**: Upon success, the next form step is triggered using `submitStep`, progressing the user through the multi-step process.

### Editing a Course

1. **Step 1**: The course data is fetched from the backend, and the form is pre-populated with existing data using `setDefaultValues`.
2. **Step 2**: The user makes changes, and the form data is again validated and prepared.
3. **Step 3**: The `EditCourse` function sends the updated data to the backend, re-uploading images or files if necessary.
4. **Step 4**: The form step is updated based on the userâ€™s progress.

## Conclusion

The `utils/functions/course` folder organizes and encapsulates course-related operations, making it easier to manage course creation and editing. By breaking down the process into reusable functions, the folder provides a clean and maintainable way to handle complex course data, API interactions, and multi-step form submissions. This modular approach allows developers to add, modify, and maintain course functionality efficiently.
