# Types Folder

The `types` directory in this Next.js application contains TypeScript definition files that define the types and interfaces used throughout the application. This folder helps ensure type safety and provides better tooling support by allowing developers to understand the shape of data structures and the expected types of variables.

## Purpose

The main goals of the `types` folder are to:

- Centralize type definitions and interfaces to promote consistency across the application.
- Enhance code readability and maintainability by providing clear contracts for data structures and function parameters.
- Enable better TypeScript tooling and autocompletion features in development environments.

## Structure

The `types` folder is structured to contain individual files for different categories of type definitions without any nested folders. Below is an example of how it may look:

```
/types
  ├── api.d.ts
  ├── user.d.ts
  ├── product.d.ts
  └── common.d.ts
```

### Files and Their Purpose

- **`api.d.ts`**: Contains type definitions for API responses and requests.

  ```typescript
  export interface ApiResponse<T> {
    data: T;
    status: number;
    message?: string;
  }

  export interface UserRequest {
    username: string;
    password: string;
  }
  ```

- **`user.d.ts`**: Defines types related to user data and profiles.

  ```typescript
  export interface User {
    id: string;
    username: string;
    email: string;
    createdAt: Date;
  }

  export interface UserProfile {
    userId: string;
    bio?: string;
    avatarUrl?: string;
  }
  ```

- **`product.d.ts`**: Contains type definitions for product-related data structures.

  ```typescript
  export interface Product {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    description: string;
    price: number;
    inStock: boolean;
  }

  export interface ProductReview {
    productId: string;
    userId: string;
    rating: number;
    comment?: string;
  }
  ```

- **`common.d.ts`**: Provides commonly used types and interfaces that are used throughout the application.

  ```typescript
  export type ID = string | number;

  export interface Pagination {
    page: number;
    pageSize: number;
    totalItems: number;
  }
  ```

## Usage

To use the types defined in this folder, simply import them into your TypeScript files as needed:

```typescript
import { User, UserProfile } from "../types/user";
import { ApiResponse } from "../types/api";

const fetchUserProfile = async (
  userId: string
): Promise<ApiResponse<UserProfile>> => {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`);
  const data: ApiResponse<UserProfile> = await response.json();
  return data;
};
```

## Best Practices

- **Keep Types Organized**: Group related types in their respective files to make it easier to locate and maintain type definitions.
- **Document Types**: Provide comments or JSDoc-style documentation for each type and interface to clarify their purpose and usage.
- **Use Descriptive Names**: Choose clear and descriptive names for types and interfaces to enhance understanding and readability.
